1. If you test in the browser, **DELETE CACHE** and use **New Incognito Window**  every time before test.
2. When you test file upload/download, Upload a **DIFFERENT/NEW** file every time you do the test. Don't always use the SAME file to do the test. Sometimes, the same file may be cached, affecting the result.
