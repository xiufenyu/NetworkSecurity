# What is Port Forwarding
Port forwarding, also known as port management, allows remote servers and devices on the internet to be able to access devices that are on a private network. It basically makes your computer accessible over the Internet, even though you are behind a router (in a NAT network). 

If you are not using port forwarding, only devices on that private internal network can have access to each other or your network. 

However, there are some times when you need to grant access to an outside source whether it be to your clients or business partners to your documents or other elements within your network. Port forwarding will help you do that.

The way that port forwarding works is you configure an internal IP address on the firewall. Then you associate that internal IP address with an external IP address. The devices on the Internet know how to reach.
